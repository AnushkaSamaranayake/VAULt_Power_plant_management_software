The dataset includes 273 images.
Anomalies are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Randomly crop between 0 and 29 percent of the image
* Random shear of between -14째 to +14째 horizontally and -11째 to +11째 vertically
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 1.9 pixels
