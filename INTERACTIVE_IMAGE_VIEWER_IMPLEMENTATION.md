# Interactive Image Viewer Implementation

## Layout Structure

### New Layout Design
The thermal image analysis interface now uses a strategic three-panel layout:

1. **Top Panel**: Current Inspection (Maintenance) Image
   - Full-width display for primary focus
   - Enhanced height (400px) for detailed viewing
   - Interactive zoom/pan controls
   - Full-screen modal access

2. **Bottom Panel**: Side-by-Side Comparison
   - **Left**: Baseline Reference Image
     - Shows transformer's normal thermal signature
     - Weather conditions and capture date info
     - Interactive controls for detailed inspection
   - **Right**: AI Analysis Results
     - Current maintenance image with AI bounding boxes
     - Anomaly detection overlays
     - Confidence level controls and analysis results

### Previous vs Current Layout

**Previous Layout**:
```
[Maintenance Image] | [Baseline Image]
           [AI Analysis Image]
```

**New Layout**:
```
      [Maintenance Image - Full Width]
[Baseline Image] | [AI Analysis Image]
```

This arrangement provides better focus hierarchy and comparison capabilities.

## Usage Instructions

### Basic Image Interaction
1. **Zoom**: Use mouse wheel over any image to zoom in/out
2. **Pan**: Click and drag to move around when zoomed in
3. **Reset**: Click the reset button (circular arrow) to return to original view
4. **Full-screen**: Click the expand button to open image in full-screen modal

### Control Buttons
- **üîç+**: Zoom in button
- **üîç-**: Zoom out button  
- **‚Üª**: Reset view button
- **üìã**: Instructions (shows "Drag" with move icon)

### Zoom Level Indicator
- Displays current zoom percentage in top-right corner
- Updates in real-time as you zoom

### AI Analysis Integration
- Bounding boxes automatically scale with zoom level
- Toggle bounding box visibility with checkbox
- Zoom into specific anomalies for detailed inspection
- Confidence levels remain visible at all zoom levels

## Technical Implementation Details

### Zoom Mechanism
- Uses CSS `transform: scale()` for smooth scaling
- Zoom range: 10% to 500% (0.1x to 5x)
- Mouse wheel zoom focuses towards cursor position
- Button zoom focuses towards image center

### Pan/Drag Implementation
- Uses CSS `transform: translate()` for positioning
- Tracks mouse movement during drag operations
- Prevents text selection and image dragging during interaction
- Smooth transitions when not actively dragging

### Overlay Synchronization
- Bounding box canvas scales and translates with image
- Uses same transform values as image element
- Maintains pixel-perfect alignment at all zoom levels
- Automatic redraw when image loads or zoom changes

### Performance Optimizations
- Debounced wheel events to prevent excessive redraws
- Conditional canvas updates only when necessary
- Smooth CSS transitions for better user experience
- Efficient event listener management

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with CSS3 transform support
- Chrome 60+, Firefox 55+, Safari 10+, Edge 79+
- Responsive design works on desktop and tablet devices
- Touch devices not currently optimized (desktop-focused)

## Future Enhancements
1. Touch/gesture support for mobile devices
2. Keyboard shortcuts for zoom/pan operations
3. Minimap for navigation in highly zoomed images
4. Image comparison tools (overlay, split-view)
5. Measurement tools for distance/area calculations
6. Export functionality for zoomed/cropped regions
